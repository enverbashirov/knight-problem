The given problem of finding minimum-length knight moves doesn't necessarily require applying machine learning/deep learning or distributed systems directly. However, let's explore potential approaches leveraging some of the mentioned technologies for various purposes:

**Approaches**

**1. Graph Search Algorithms:**

- **BFS (Breadth-First Search):** This classic algorithm provides the optimal solution by systematically exploring all possible paths level by level until reaching the target. It's efficient for smaller chessboards due to its exhaustive nature.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** This algorithm finds the shortest path by iteratively updating distances from the source, ensuring optimality. It's more efficient than BFS for sparse graphs or with specific distance heuristics.

**2. Reinforcement Learning:**

- **Model-based RL:** Train a policy network to control the knight's movement using a reward system that assigns higher rewards for shorter paths. This could be explored for complex chessboard variations or dynamic obstacles.
- **Model-free RL:** Train a value network to evaluate the "goodness" of each board state without explicitly modeling the entire board. This requires a large training dataset of various starting and ending positions.

**Systems and Scalability:**

**1. AWS:**

- For large-scale datasets or training reinforcement learning models, consider AWS services like S3 for data storage, EC2 instances for training, and SageMaker for managed machine learning training and deployment.

**2. Docker/Docker Compose:**

- Package your Python script and dependencies into a Docker image for easy deployment and reproducibility across different environments. Docker Compose helps manage multi-container setups if needed.

**3. Distributed Architectures:**

- If working with massive chessboards or training complex models, explore distributed architectures like Apache Spark or TensorFlow Distributed for parallel processing and efficient computation.
